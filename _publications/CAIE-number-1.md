This paper introduces an innovative Supplier Selection and Order Allocation (SSOA) method that combines mathematical modeling and machine learning. Focusing on the dynamic aspects of supply chain management, this approach uniquely considers the impact of order quantity and timing on suppliers’ performance and reliability. Using a simulation model for a 3-echelon supply chain as a test bed, we integrate a machine learning model to predict suppliers’ lead times and a mathematical optimization model to create a dynamic and adaptive SSOA process. The simulation model is developed using Anylogic, allowing interaction between the machine learning and mathematical models. The machine learning model, developed using TensorFlow, predicts lead times from order-related features, while the mathematical model, leveraging linear programming, optimizes supplier selection based on these predictions. The iterative process between machine learning and mathematical models refines the procurement strategies and enhances the supply chain’s responsiveness and efficiency while the solution is tested using the simulation model. The results demonstrate the potential for significant improvements in supply chain costs and customer satisfaction, highlighting the potential of this integrated approach for complex, dynamic supply chain environments. This paper contributes to the field by offering a novel, scalable solution that addresses real-world operational dynamics and paves the way for further research in adaptive supply chain management.
